        <div class="initial-ideation">
            <p>
                Hi everyone! We are group 1, otherwise known as <b>Alex’s Platoon</b>. In our group is Dan MacBlane, Sophia Savas, Alex Gonzales, Eric Seo, and Zach Tieger.<br/><br/>
                After some constructive deliberation, we decided on the idea of an event planning application that aggregates contacts, creates different groups, and emails unique QR codes to selected invitees. The main purpose of the app is to replace We believe that this application will provide significant value to the Ross School, greek life, and party planners alike. Our tentative name for this application is: <b>InviteME</b> (though we are open to suggestions).<br/><br/>
                We envision this application having three core functions that combine to create an efficient application:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>First, this application will have the functionality to record and store contact information for potential invitees. We also plan on developing the functionality to categorically group contacts based on who an organizer may be inviting to specific events. This will save an organizer time as they will be able to send out invitations to a group of contacts rather than go through the process one contact at a time. This also will mitigate the risk of potentially forgetting an invitee.</li>
                <li>Second, this application will have the capability of emailing a unique QR code to any individual saved in the contact list. The event organizer will also have the ability to send email blasts to premade groups in order to save time. The unique QR code given to each recipient will serve as both an invitation, and a record of attendance once the invitee enters the event.</li>
                <li>Third, The application will provide valuable attendance data for the event holders. When an attendee signs in, they will be logged into the system so that event makers can keep track of who attended. Use-cases for this feature include mandatory academic events, career recruiting events, and greek life rush events. This will streamline more traditional attendance keeping.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Our group strongly believes that this application will drive value in a few areas:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Ross School of Business: This application will allow administrators to invite certain groups of students to speaker series, and record their attendance for class participation. In these instances, there will no longer be a need for M-Cards, which will lessen the chance of cheating.</li>
                <li>Corporate recruiting events: This will function in a similar way to Ross Speaker events. In this scenario, however, companies will be able to scan students in and track their attendance to see who is interested in the company (who is attending most events).</li>
                <li>University Greek Life: Fraternities and Sororities will be able to make groups of people that they commonly invite to their parties, and then scan them in once they arrive. This will also remove the need to carry an M-Card, which many students complain about when they are going to parties or rush events.</li>
                <li>Individual Event Planning: While the QR code may not drive as much value here, this platform will still give party planning enthusiasts a good outlet to invite their friends to fun events.</li>
                <li>Student organizations on campus: This application will allow student organizations to more effectively plan fundraising events with better coordination and organization with restaurants. Restaurants can efficiently track the amount of additional business they are getting from the student organizations and student organizations can more easily prove their contribution to the business for a mutually beneficial agreement between two parties.</li>
            </ol>

                TO 426 Group Assignment #1<br/>
                Group 2 - Chad Catt, Veronica Day, Shawn Dong, Gustave Alé Svensson, Cassandra Wong<br/>
                October 3, 2018<br/><br/>
                <b>App Name:</b> Arete: The Personal Development Project<br/><br/>
                <b>Idea behind the name and the app:</b> Arete is a term in Greek that, in its basic form, means “Excellence of any kind”. This notion of excellence was ultimately bound up with the notion of the fulfillment of purpose or function: the act of living up to one’s full potential. This app is designed to do just that; Help people remain mentally healthy and self-conscious while consistently setting & reaching for their goals by completing a number of small tasks day in and day out.<br/>
                As many of us have experienced or seen others struggle with, we all have huge goals in life. Many people eventually get discouraged by the size of these goals and either get incredibly stressed or quit due to the helplessness they feel. In using this app, it not only helps to break these goals down into bite sized pieces, but also helps in creating positive habits for productivity and mental health. Thus, maximizing our days and reaching our full potential.<br/><br/>
                <b>Core Features Description:</b><br/>
                We were inspired by Robert Pasick’s book Journal for Self-Aware: A Guide for Success in Work and Life and Gustav’s MO324 class to create an app that aims to help users improve their mental health and productivity. In our app, the user will be able to establish goals in the morning, review/accomplish them throughout the day, and reflect upon them in the evening. This reflection process will include giving the user a space to write down how they felt about these goals and list goals that they want to achieve in the future. By doing so, the user can keep track of these goals and feel proud of themselves for their accomplishments as times goes on. The point behind using the app is to develop positive habits and become aware of their mental state throughout the day.<br/><br/>
                <b>Details:</b><br/>
                In the morning, the user will open the Arete app and be asked to complete 3 tasks:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Answer the question: “I’d feel great about today if…”</li>
                <li>Set 3-5 goals to achieve today. (Work out, complete HW, make 5 calls to clients, etc)</li>
                <li>Complete today’s self awareness task. (Auto assigned from a list of exercises loaded into the app.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                We want to implement a self-awareness exercise to allow the user to think more about self-positivity and have a healthy mental attitude towards their day. An example of a self-awareness exercise could be asking the user to think about something that they used to do when they were younger that they no longer do and to remember what made them happy when doing this. This aims to get the user thinking about life in a unique, creative, and stimulating way.<br/>
                Next, we were thinking that if the day was in the beginning of the week, we will prompt the user to write down some attainable goals (maybe three to five) for the week. These goals will show up for the rest of that week with a check box the user can interact with to mark off whenever he has completed the respective goal. Every time the user checks off a goal, we want to include a reflection box that is optional for the user to jot down some notes about how he felt about achieving the goal, and whether they want to add another goal for that week. After the reflection box is completed (regardless of whether there is text put in it or not), there will be a message congratulating the user and make him feel validated. (Note these “weekly goals” are on top of the daily goals we mention previously)<br/>
                Finally, throughout the day, we want the app to send the user notifications/reminders for 2 things:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Check in on current goal progress. (both daily and monthly goals)</li>
                <li>Take a minute to be present in the moment (Enjoy the process) and take a minute to clear their mind if they are stressed. (Meditate, etc)</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                These reminders will be in the form of a notification, so even if the user is busy and can’t check their phone, there would still be a high chance they see it. The user will also be able to customize when and how many reminders they receive throughout the day to help lead to successful/effective reminders.<br/>
                In the evening, there will be an opportunity for the user to see the goals they set (e.g. the weekly goals and the daily mini-goals) and reflect upon them. There will also be a space where they can set goals for the next day or just write down any important notes in particular. Then, the app will end the day with a positive mentality statement and encourage the user to keep up the great work and take a minute to decompress after a day of crushing it.<br/>
                We are currently considering adding a friend aspect to this where it shows friends your progress on the day to get further recognition through the app. However, this has positive and negative parts as you can tell such as added pressure and potentially unhealthy competition.<br/>
                Finally, every other week, or every month, the app will remind you of all you have done recently to show you how well you are doing. It is easy to forget how much we really get done in a week. (or each month!)<br/>
                The app will also be able to hold onto longer term goals and will periodically check in on how you are doing on these / suggest you set daily goals relating to achieving this goal.<br/><br/>
                Thanks for reading this lengthy description and please let us know of any great ideas you guys may have for this!

            <p>
                We want to do a mental health / personal wellness app of some sort. We still haven't decided the exact functionality of it, but we are looking to include some assortment of the following:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Destressing games</li>
                <li>Guided meditation</li>
                <li>Note down 3 good things that happened to you at the EOD</li>
                <li>Some feature to motivate user not to use phone</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                We'll tentatively call it MiniBuddha. The value in building this is that there is increasing concern that phone usage negatively impacts mental health, but phones are so ingrained in society that the best course of action is finding out how to use phones to mitigate possible negative impacts such as stress.

                Hello Everyone! We're Group 4, or as we like to call ourselves, <b>GroupThink</b>!<br/>
                The background for our idea was based around our discussions of the difficulty of scheduling group meetings, understanding exactly what we have planned, and inefficiencies that might go occur in when a group meets up.<br/><br/>
                App Name (Tentative): <b>GroupThink</b><br/><br/>
                Step by Step Functionalities of the Application:<br/>
                <b>Step 1:</b> Consumers will be assigned an account based off of phone number and once the account is created, similar to GroupMe, consumers will create their own groups in order to start accessing the functionality of the application. A server to store account information and group information will be created to hold all of the data both user and group.<br/>
                <b>Step 2:</b> After a group is created, using basic calendars groups can enter in a time and day for when to meet. In order to streamline the availability process, users can import their own calendars or enter calendar information for themselves so that the application can suggest times that each group member is free. Users will, of course, be able to input restrictions as to the timings of when to meet (Ex. No Meetings after 2 AM).<br/>
                <b>Step 3:</b> With the Group created and meetings designed, group topics, polls, charts, graphics, files and much more will all be subdivided into their respective categories under the meeting to take place.<br/>
                <b>Step 4:</b> With all of the information, files, and decisions to be made under each group meeting, users will be able to suggest time lengths for each topic to be discussed or worked upon.<br/><br/>
                <b>Mapping of Example:</b> User Ali creates a group with users Marius, Robert, and Griffin. Needing to work on their TO 426 project, Ali creates a meeting with suggested times for the group to meet. Group members then either accept or reject and/or propose another time for the group to meet. After meeting time is accepted by all group members, Ali will upload a poll to see whether or not the group would like to include Bluetooth capabilities, Marius will upload the meeting minutes from the previous meeting, Griffin will highlight key objectives to complete in the time frame, and Robert will edit Griffin's objectives and input new items to the agenda.<br/><br/>
                Thank you for taking the time to read our app idea! All of this is tentative and will most likely include changes in order to better fulfill user needs. We would very much appreciate your thoughts and critiques.<br/><br/>
                <b>Our Mission:</b> Create a platform for group work to be organized, productive, and successful!<br/>

                Group 5 (Paws): Anurag Bolneni, Nicket Patel, Jeffrey Zhang, Husain Taher, Lauren Ward<br/>
                App: The Puppy App<br/><br/>
                Our idea for this app originated when one of our members mentioned he was getting a puppy in the near future. We realized that Ann Arbor has many dogs but no means of connecting dogs and owners alike. We hope this app will ultimately bridge that divide!<br/><br/>
                <b>Purpose</b>
                The app will be multi-purpose with the goal of connecting dog lovers. Dog owners and dog lovers alike will be able to make accounts and use to app to facilitate interactions with one another. The app will be a one-stop-shop for all social interactions between people involving dogs, hence “The Puppy App”. The strengths of the app will be ease of use, an appealing user interface, and a wide array of functionality that different people can take advantage of.<br/><br/>
                <b>Functionality</b>
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Users of the app create login credentials and taken to the home page, where they are then able to decide between two options: Dog owner or Dog Lover.</li>
                <li>Based on the choice there will be two seperate pages. Dog owner's can create profiles for their dogs including information such as breed, age, characteristics, etc.  Furthermore, they can create events, detailing the Date, Time, and Location of potential play dates.</li>
                <li>Once the event is created, it will be visible to other users of the app within a specified distance of the event location.</li>
                <li>Users, whether they are dog owners or not, will be able to sign up for the event. Dog lovers can create profiles for types of dogs/events they are looking for. They can then look at existing events based on their preferences or even all events and sign up accordingly.</li>
                <li>Dog Lovers and Owners alike meet up in Ann Arbor and enjoy the event together.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                <b>Potential Ideas</b>
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Facilitate puppy meet-ups in AA.</li>
                <li>Can branch into meetups for children, dogsitting, hospital visits, therapy dogs for students, puppy-puppy meetups</li>
                <li>Upload profiles that include information and personality of puppy, pictures, and short bio of the puppy owner</li>
                <li>Build in a way for people to pay for interactions and services</li>
                <li>Have functionality for people to choose which dogs they want to interact with (like “swiping” left or right or a way of “liking” a profile)</li>
                <li>A direct message function to facilitate communication</li>
                <li>“Suggesting” potential matches</li>
                <li>Expanding to include other animals?</li>
                <li>Filters by breed of dog, age, distance away from user, personality</li>
                <li>Use maps API to see where meetups will occur</li>
                <li>Fun interface and text</li>
            </ol>
            <p>

        <h4>Initial Thoughts:</h4>

                Our Group (Group 6 - Group Name: The Dare Devils) is made up of myself (Danny Kahn), Jordan Camina, Zach Gerndt, and Mugdh Agarwal.<br/>
                We came up with the idea of making a game for our app. We all enjoy socializing and thought it would be a cool idea to create a unique game for social settings that take people out of there comfort zone with friends.<br/>
                Our tentative name for this game is called PeerPressure. Here is what we currently envision for the app/game:<br/><br/>
                Game App Name: <b>PeerPressure</b><br/>
                <u>Step 1:</u> Players (likely a group of friends) login to the app through their fb/account info that is accessed through an online server --> all players are then connected into one game room.<br/>
                <u>Step 2:</u> All players write a really good & outgoing dare/action/funny performance, etc. that they want to see someone else do/perform during the game. The time limit to write your dare is 1 minute (if you get desperate as you run out of time you can hit "random secret dare" that automatically makes a dare for you).<br/>
                <u>Step 3:</u> When everyone has inputted their answers, the game proceeds then randomly chooses two players whose dare answers will battle against each other.<br/>
                <u>Step 4:</u> The two player’s inputted dares come up on the screen (but does not show who wrote which dare) and everyone else that is playing votes on whose dare they would rather see done. (Keep in mind that no one knows who will be doing the dare that gets chosen so there is no singling someone out).<br/>
                <u>Step 5:</u> After all players have voted, the player whose dare got the fewer amount of votes has to do the dare that beat them in the round!<br/>
                <u>Step 6:</u> The player who lost then executes the dare and everyone votes on a scale of 1-10 at the end of the dare performance on how well they thought that player completed his or her dare task.<br/>
                <u>Step 7:</u> The winner at the very end is the person who got the highest average vote after all rounds have been completed (meaning all dares have been voted upon during the rounds).<br/><br/>
                We are looking forward to hearing feedback for improvement and clarification from the class. Thanks!
